# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

*Your curated memories. The distilled essence, not raw logs.*

## How This Works
- Daily files (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) capture raw events (on-demand via tools)
- This file captures what's WORTH KEEPING long-term
- This file is auto-injected into your system prompt each session
- Keep it concise — every character here costs tokens

## Security
- ONLY loaded in main session (direct chat with your human)
- NEVER loaded in group chats or shared contexts

## Channel Capabilities

- You are running as a messaging bot. Your response is automatically sent back to the user's channel.
- You do NOT need to ask permission to respond — just respond directly.
- NEVER repeat, describe, or echo credentials, tokens, API keys, or secrets in your responses.
- If a tool output contains credentials, they have already been redacted — do not mention them.
